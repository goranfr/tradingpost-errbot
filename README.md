=============

## Overview
A simple Magic: the Gathering bot, implemented as an Errbot plugin.

## Deployment 
### Plugin for existing Errbot
If you already have a Errbot installation running you can install tradingpost-errbot as a plugin. See [Errbot's documentation](http://errbot.io/en/latest/user_guide/administration.html) for further instructions.

### Self-Assembler (Slack bot)
tradingpost-errbot is included as a submodule in self-assembler-bot, an Errbot-based Slack bot design for self-hosting of a Slack bot with tradingpost-errbot. See [self-assembler-bot](https://github.com/torgeirl/self-assembler-bot) for futher instructions.

## Credits
tradingpost-errbot is a port of [tradingpost-beepboop](https://github.com/torgeirl/tradingpost-beepboop), a [BeepBoop](https://beepboophq.com/docs/article/overview)-hostable Slack bot. I got the inspiration to make tradingpost-beepboop after seeing Filip SÃ¶derholm's [cardfetcher bot](https://github.com/fiso/cardfetcher) in action, and I have re-used part of his code while making Tradingpost.
